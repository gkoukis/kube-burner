flannel - limit 50 pods

1. kubelet-density-cni: This creates deployments of node.js
webservers fronted by services and another deployment of pods that
run curl against the webserver service for readiness probe. This ensures
that the curl pods only go into ready when they are able to reach the
webserver srvice. kube-burner accordingly accounts for this delay in the
podready metrics.

kubelet-density: This is the most simple workload possible. It basically creates pods using an sleep image. Useful to verify max-pods in worker nodes.
